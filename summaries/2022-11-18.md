## Summary

### Event Listeners

- See support file `support/e2e.ts`

With event listeners we can listen to events from the browser or cypress itself.
We implemented a cypress event listener in the `support/e2e.ts`
This file will run before all tests and will log out the test object on every `test:before:run` event.

### Cypress Promises (Promise like)

- See spec file `2022-11-18.cy.ts`

Cypress commands are promise like.
Below some code how you can interact with them.
You can only use `.then()` on a Promise or promise like object.

```javascript
// Cypress commands are `Promise like`
// if cy.get() is resolved it yields its subject to the next command etc.
cy.get('input').first().click()

// If we want to do something with the subject we can use .then() or .should()
// This .then() is similar to the use with native Promises
// With .should() there is automatic retry
cy.get('input')
  .first()
  .should((el) => {
    console.log(el)
  })
```
