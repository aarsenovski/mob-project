## Summary

We created a cypress pipeline utilizing the GitHub actions syntax `.github\workflows\cypress.yml` in this project.

The file contains specifications for the workflow, including the events that trigger it. It defines a task to be executed on an Ubuntu platform and outlines the necessary procedures.

```
name: cypress-workflow
on: pull_request

jobs:
  cypress-pipeline:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        name: checkout

      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        name: cypress
```
- `name` field  defines a name for the workflow.

- `on` field specifies that the workflow will be triggered when a pull request event occurs.

- `runs-on` field specifies that the job will run on an Ubuntu environment. 

- `steps` field defines the individual steps for the job.

- `actions/checkout@v3` step to check out the repository's code.
  
- `name: checkout` a personalized name is assigned to the checkout step.
  
- `cypress-io/github-action@v5` 
  
    - It invokes the cypress GitHub action to run cypress tests.
  
    - It enhances the process by integrating the installation dependencies and Cypress test execution steps, minimizing the requirement for separate actions and simplifying the workflow.
