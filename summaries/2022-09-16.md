## Summary

We wrote a Cypress test together for checking the sending of request headers.

> https://github.com/labdigital-frasers/storefronts/pull/377

For this test we created an alias to wait for the graphql call.
We use the `.then()` to inspect the yielded subject from the intercepted call to assert on the request headers.
