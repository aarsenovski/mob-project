## Summary

### Playwright installation

- To install playwright: `yarn create playwright`
  
- To run the test: `npx playwright test` 

### Playwright / Cypress / Selenium

  1. Playwright lets you test in several browsers simultaneously and supports multi-tabs and frames.
   
  2. Contrary to other solutions, Playwright doesn’t use the WebDriver protocol. It leverages the Chrome DevTools protocol to communicate with Chromium browsers (Chrome/Edge) directly.
   
  3. Selenium requires the installation of browser drivers so that the script can interact with the web elements on the page. However Cypress does not have any additional dependencies, extra downloads since the test cases run directly inside the browser.
   
  4. In Cypress there is no necessity for adding implicit and explicit wait statements since Cypress automatically waits for the element to exist in the DOM. It also waits for commands and assertions before the execution moves to the next statement.

### Playwright report

Trace Viewer:
 
 We need to modify the `playwright.config.ts` file. It allows us to view the trace file of your test and interact with it.

  Trace viewer options,

    1. 'off' - Do not record a trace
    2. 'on' - Record a trace for each test
    3. 'retain-on-failure' - Record a trace for each test, but remove it from successful test runs
    4. 'on-first-retry' - Record a trace only when retrying a test for the first time 

### Playwright config file

- See spec file `playwright.config.ts`
    
Change the testDir to - `/playwright/tests` 
   
### Playwright test

- See spec file `2022-11-25.spec.ts`
  
We wrote our first playwright test to visit the url

Commands learned in this session: 

```javascript
// Playwright Test provides a test function to declare tests and expect function to write assertions
import { test } from '@playwright/test'

// The keyword async before a function makes the function return a promise
test('Google page', async ({ page }) => {})

//The keyword await before a function makes the function wait for a promise
await page.goto('https://google.com')

// To take the screenshot
await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png', fullPage: true }) 

// Selectors are the strings/properties of the web objects and used to create Locators. Locator is a class in Playwright library
await page.locator('button', { hasText: 'Alles accepteren' }).click() 
``` 

- To install playwright: `yarn create playwright`

We wrote our first playwright test to visit a url

Commands that used in this session:

```javascript
// To visit the url
await page.goto('https://google.com')
// To take the screenshot
await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png', fullPage: true })
// To find the descriped text on the page
await page.locator('button', { hasText: 'Alles accepteren' }).click()
```
