## Summary

Develop an automated smoke-test to run at every deployment in order to make sure all SEO requirements have been met in our project. The smoke-test will indicate early on after deployment whether we are missing any SEO requirements or not.  

## SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

An SEO smoke test is a quick and basic assessment of a website's search engine optimization. It's usually an initial test done to identify any major issues with a website's SEO that may prevent it from being indexed and ranked by search engines. 

A smoke test typically includes a review of the below, 

-	Title tags and meta description tags

- Pagination tag

-	Canonical tag

-	Sitemap

const pages = [
  { name: 'Homepage', url: '/' },
  { name: 'Product List Page', url: 'search?q=a' },
  { name: 'Product Detail Page', url: product.slug },
]
pages.forEach((page) => {
  it(`should contain correct SEO tags - "${page.name}"`, () => {
    cy.request(page.url).then((res) => {
