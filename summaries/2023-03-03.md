## Summary

Map, reduce, and filter are all array methods in JavaScript. Each one will iterate over an array and perform a transformation or computation. Each will return a new array based on the result of the function.

Continuing from the last MOB session with TDD, we once again wrote unit tests about manipulating an array: doubling the values, taking out the even values and making a sum of all the values in the array.

The function `manipulateArray` returns an object consisting of four key-pair values.

1. The original property returns the array intact.
2. The doubled property makes use of the `Map` array method and maps every value in the array, then doubles it by two with `numbers.map((n) => n * 2)`
3. The `even` property makes use of the `Filter` array method, goes through every element in the array and filters out the even numbers with `numbers.filter((n) => n % 2 === 0)`
4. The `sum` property makes use of the `Reduce` array method and reduces the array of values down to just one value, adding up the values in the process with `numbers.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0)`

After that, all running tests passed.
