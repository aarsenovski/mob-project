## Summary

### Cypress viewport

- See spec file `2022-10-28.cy.ts` and support file `support/preview.ts`

The viewport configurations are defined in the support file.
To use this configuration we export it as a `named export`

In the spec file we loop over these configiration to run the specs against multiple viewports.
We loop over the viewports array with the `forEach` method.

To show against which viewport the test is run we dynamically change the describe name using a `template literal`
A template literal is a way to concatenate strings.

### Cypress custom commands

- See spec file `2022-10-28.cy.ts` and `commands.ts`

For reusable methods we can create custom Cypress commands.
These methods are defined in the `commands.ts` file using the `Cypress.Commands.add()` method.
After defining the custom method we can use it in our Cypress tests with `cy.methodName()`

These methods are defined on the `cy` namespace, so we don't need to import them.
You can also use regular JavaScript methods to do the same, they do need to get imported.
