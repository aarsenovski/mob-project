## Summary

We debugged a test from the storefronts repository.
The issue was that the validation on the order of products for the PLP was incorrect.
More detailed information can be found by clicking on the step in the Cypress Command Log with your console open.

For failing tests in CI/CD it's possible to download the `artifacts` of the run.

The issue was that there were 2 lists of products so it was needed to be more specific with the locator.
We used the Cypress `.find()` method for this.
