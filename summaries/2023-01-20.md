## Summary

Discussed a general outline and the specifics of writing Cypress tests for an open source website on the website's structure and functionality.

### hard coded inside the custom method 

Hard-coding inside a custom method refers to the practice of including specific values or data directly within the method's code. This means that the method will always use the same data or values, regardless of any external inputs or variables.

This approach can be problematic for several reasons:

-	It makes the method less flexible and reusable, as it can only be used in specific situations where the hard-coded values match the intended use case.

-	It can make the method more difficult to maintain, as any changes to the hard-coded values require modifying the method's code.

-	It can also make the code less readable and less maintainable.
It is generally better to avoid hard-coding values inside a custom method. Instead, the method should take external inputs or variables as parameters, and use those inputs to perform its calculations. This makes the method more flexible, reusable, and maintainable.

### fixture file

A fixture file contains data that is used to set up a known state for a test. Fixture files are commonly used in automated testing to provide test data that can be used to run tests against a known set of data.

Benefits of fixture file:

- The use of fixtures to store test data separates the test itself from the data, allowing for the reuse of the same test method with different data. This has the advantage of making the tests more modular and easier to maintain, as changes to the test data do not affect the test logic. 

- Additionally, using fixtures can make it easier to manage large amounts of test data, as it can be stored in a centralized location and accessed by multiple tests as needed.
