## Summary

We created a unit test which mocked data in order to test the functionality of a method. Available code as part of the mob-programming session can be found inside folder `unittest/beer.js` in this project.

We override the global fetch function with a jest mocked version of it allowing the test to mock the fetch method and don't perform the real call. The promise resolved with array of object BEERS.

```
global.fetch = jest.fn(() =>
  Promise.resolve({
    json: () => Promise.resolve(BEERS),
  })
)
```

We then store the object in a constant and supply the test data.

```
const BEERS = [
  {
    price: '$16.99',
    name: 'Founders All Day IPA',
    rating: { average: 4.411243509154233, reviews: 453 },

    id: 1,
  }
```

In the test itself we store the value of the api call which is mocked and make an assertion against that response.

```
test('test for the first beer price', async () => {
const response = await api.getBeers()
expect(response[0].price).toBe('$16.99')
})
```
